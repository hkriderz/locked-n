Cursor Rules: Refactoring & Cleanup

Keep code readable, maintainable, and consistent.

Remove unused imports, variables, functions, components, and files.

Delete console logs and commented-out code (unless marked TODO).

Break down large functions/components into smaller reusable ones.

Use descriptive names and avoid duplicate logic.

Replace magic numbers with constants.

Simplify nested logic with early returns.

Ensure Tree-shaking friendly imports and minimal Tailwind class duplication.

Run TypeScript checks + ESLint/Prettier after refactoring.

Check for any Type Errors.

Make small, focused commits with refactor: prefix.
